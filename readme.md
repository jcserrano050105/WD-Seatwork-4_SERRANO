It consists of multiple pages, each dedicated to a different theme or subject, and includes various sections highlighting specific content through engaging visuals and interactive elements.
- Whats the purpose - The primary purpose of the project is to demonstrate the use of HTML and CSS to create visually appealing and functionally rich web pages. The website aims to showcase the capabilities of these core web technologies in building interactive and responsive user experiences.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
